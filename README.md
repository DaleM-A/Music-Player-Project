# custom-music-player
Actively developing a custom music player application using Python, integrating Tkinter for GUI, Pygame for audio playback, and PIL for album cover display, with a focus on real-time UI interaction and efficient memory usage. 

I wanted to create this application so that I could play my own .wav/.mp3 files without using Mac/Windows native tools. 

To create/add to the project, you'll have to import or install the following:

* tkinter
* customtkinter
* pygame
* pillow
* threading
* time

I've included a couple of tunes that you can download for testing purposes (I do not own the rights to the music or album art). 

Comments in the code should explain what each block does. 

Currently trying to make the progress bar match the length of the song. 

Feel free to contribute, would love to see what amazing things you can add. 

Any questions, please reach out!
